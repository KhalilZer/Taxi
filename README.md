# Taxi Project

This project is a taxi management application structured into two main parts:

## Taxi Folder

The **taxi** folder contains the frontend of the application, which has been built using **React.js** and **Vite**. This part of the application is responsible for the user interface and user interactions.

## Server Folder

The **server** folder contains the API of the application, which has been developed using **Laravel**. This part handles the backend logic and communication with the database, allowing for the management of bookings and taxi information.
